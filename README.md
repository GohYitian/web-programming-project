## **Overview:**

<p align=justify> Covid-19 Vaccination Booking System (CVBS) is a website that provides the services
that are related to Covid-19 such as tracking hotspots and booking Covid-19
vaccination.</p>

<p align=justify> There are 3 actors involved in the CVBS website, which are users, admin, and guests.
Admin will take the responsibility to manage booking vaccination forms that have
been submitted by users, and update the details of the number of cases of Covid-19 by
states everyday. Besides that, users are able to book the vaccination via the CVBS
website and track the Covid-19 hotspot. As a guest, tracking for hotspots and the
information of services provided in the website is only allowed to be used and viewed
in the CVBS website.</p>

<p align=justify> The objectives of this project are to smooth the process of users in applying for the
vaccination and tracking for the Covid-19 area. The goal of this project is to provide
fast and efficient services regarding covid-19 to different users.</p>
